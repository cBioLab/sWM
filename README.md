# **sWM**

C++ implementation of sWM

# Summary
This library is the implementation of sWM. 

# List of Supported CPUs and Operating Systems
* Intel 64-bit CPUs
* 64-bit Linux (tested on ubuntu 14.04 LTS and ubuntu 16.04 LTS)

# List of Supported Compilers and Prerequisite Tools
* gcc 4.8.4 + OpenSSL 1.0.1f + GMP 5.1.3

# Installation Requirements

Create a working directory (e.g., work) and clone the following repositories.

       mkdir work
       cd work
       git clone git://github.com/cBioLab/sWM.git
       git clone git://github.com/iskana/PBWT-sec.git
       git clone git://github.com/herumi/xbyak.git
       git clone git://github.com/herumi/mcl.git
       git clone git://github.com/herumi/cybozulib.git
       git clone git://github.com/herumi/cybozulib_ext.git

* Xbyak is a prerequisite for optimizing the operations in the finite field on Intel CPUs.
* OpenSSL and libgmp-dev are available via apt-get (or other similar commands).

# Installation
		cd sWM/src
		make

* use tcmalloc (optimal) for Linux; sudo apt-get install libgoogle-perftools-dev

# Prerequisite Files and Libraries for Running Your Application
	* OpenSSL
	* GMP (libgmp-dev)

# Running sWM with a sample data
Server:
		
		cd sWM/bin
		./server -c <num_of_threads> -f ../data/server/sample.wm -p <portã€€number> -e <epsilon>

Client:

		cd sWM/bin
		./client -c <num_of_threads> -h <hostname> -f ../data/client/sample.que -p <port number>

# Making WM file
		cd sWM/tool/bin
		./strtowav.sh < <sequence file> > <WM file>

# Sequence file format
 	   1st line	 : The length of the sequence data
	   2nd line	 : The alpabet size of this sequence data 
	   3rd line  : Sequence data

# Query file format
	   1st line	 : The length of the query data
	   2nd line	 : The alpabet size of this query data   
	   3rd line  : Query data

# Data format
Both query and sequence data should be described as a series of numbers. A space is used as a delimiter.
e.g., 1 2 15 4 2 1 3
